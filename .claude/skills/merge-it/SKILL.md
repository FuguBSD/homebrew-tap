# Merge it

Merge a patch-level change to `main` without a pull request.

## Procedure

1. Update `main` from the remote. Rebase the branch onto `main`.
2. Run `make check`. It must pass.
3. Squash merge the branch into `main`. Write one Conventional Commit message.
4. Push `main`. Delete the branch.
5. When CI runs on `main`, watch it. Fix a failure immediately.
