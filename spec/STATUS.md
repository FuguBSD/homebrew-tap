# Implementation register

This register is the one record of implementation state. One row exists for each
unit of the specification. A unit is one design element of one specification
document. The [conventions](index.md#conventions) define the unit IDs. Each row
describes the current state only. A row must not carry a plan name or a
reference to an earlier state. A note can carry the date of a recorded fact.

## States

| State   | Meaning                                                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| open    | No code implements the unit.                                         |
| partial | Code implements a part of the unit. The note names each absent part. |
| done    | Code implements the full unit. The note links the code or the tests. |
| n-a     | No code can implement the unit. It exists for citation only.         |

The "Done by" column names a phase of the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md), or "—" when no
phase applies.

## Units

| Unit                              | State | Done by | Note                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [TAP-FORMULA](tap.md#tap-formula) | done  | —       | [Formula](../Formula)                                                   |
| [TAP-GATE](tap.md#tap-gate)       | done  | —       | [local.mk](../mk/local.mk), [check.yml](../.github/workflows/check.yml) |

## Update protocol

1. The change that implements a unit, or a part of one, sets the unit state in
   this register in the same change.
2. A `partial` note names each absent rule or part.
3. A `done` note holds at least one relative link to code or to tests.

## Code roots

The drift gate maps each document to the code that implements it.

| Document | Roots                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| tap.md   | `Formula`, `mk`, `.github`, `deps` |
