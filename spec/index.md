# homebrew-tap specification

The tap holds one Homebrew formula for each FuguBSD repository that releases a
Perl distribution. `brew install fugubsd/tap/<name>` installs one from its
GitHub release, and the release workflow of each distribution keeps its formula
current. All formulae live in `Formula/`.

This document is the entry point of the specification. It holds the plan
contract, the ID conventions, and the document tables.

## Plan contract

- Read [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) before you make a plan.
- A plan must not go against a decision. To go against a decision, propose a
  change to [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) and get human approval first.
- A plan must cite each unit that it implements, for example
  `Implements: TAP-FORMULA`.
- A plan can exclude a rule from a cited unit with `without`, for example
  `Implements: TAP-FORMULA without TAP-FORMULA-2`.
- A plan must cite each unit that it touches but defers, for example
  `Defers: TAP-GATE`.
- The change that implements a unit, or a part of one, must set the unit state
  in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) in the same change.

## Conventions

A unit is one implementable design element. An invisible HTML anchor marks each
unit, and the unit ID is the anchor in upper case:

```markdown
<a id="tap-formula"></a>

## The formulae

- **TAP-FORMULA-1** — The tap must hold …
```

- The anchor of a unit must start with the code of its document, in lower case,
  followed by a hyphen.
- A unit extends from its anchor to the next unit anchor or heading, whichever
  comes first.
- A rule ID names one requirement inside a unit. A rule is a bold-lead list
  item: the bold rule ID, one em dash, then the requirement text, as the example
  above shows.
- Rule numbers only append: never renumber a rule, and never reuse a number.
- An ID must not change. To retire a unit: delete its anchor and its register
  row, and add the ID to the "Retired IDs" table of [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).
- Each document describes the target design in the current state only. Only
  [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) say when work occurs.
- A citation of a unit of a sibling repository is a prose token with the
  repository name in front, for example Tooling WFL-BREW-3. It is never a link,
  and it never names a plan.

## Specification documents

Each document specifies one area of work. The code of a document prefixes the
IDs of its units.

| Code | Document         | Area             |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| TAP  | [tap.md](tap.md) | The Homebrew tap |

## Governance documents

These documents carry no units.

| Document                     | Role                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) | The decisions. A plan must not go against a decision. |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)     | The schedule of the work.                             |
| [STATUS.md](STATUS.md)       | The implementation register.                          |
