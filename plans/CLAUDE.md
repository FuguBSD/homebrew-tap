# plans/

Applies when working on files under `plans/`.

## Transient

- A plan merges on its own, before the implementation starts.
- The pull request that implements a plan deletes the plan directory in the same
  change.
- When a part of a plan lands, trim the citations of the plan in the same
  change, or delete the plan.
- The change that lands the rule of an `Extends:` citation must trim that
  citation.

## Location

- A plan lives in the repository that implements it. It must not describe work
  that another repository implements. The citation forms live in
  [spec/CLAUDE.md](../spec/CLAUDE.md).

## Numbering

The path is `plans/<NNN>-<slug>/plan.md`, and the first line is
`# <NNN> — <subject>`. A number is never reused, also after the deletion of its
plan. To find the next number, run:

```sh
git log --diff-filter=A --name-only --format= -- plans/ | sort -u
```

## Shape

- A plan cites each unit that it implements, extends, or defers, per the plan
  contract in [spec/index.md](../spec/index.md) and the citation forms of
  [spec/CLAUDE.md](../spec/CLAUDE.md). Every cited ID must exist.
- A plan holds a Status section: what can land now, what waits, and on what.

## Checks

`make spec-check` validates every plan. The rules of the check live at
<https://github.com/FuguBSD/Tooling/blob/main/spec/spec-check.md>.
